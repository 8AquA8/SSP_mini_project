##Abstract
In the mini project, I worked on the efficiency and scalability of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) compared to Exact Diagonalization (ED) in solving the Quantum Ising Chain problem. It highlights that ED, while precise, becomes impractical for large systems due to its exponential time complexity. VQE, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, offers a more scalable solution with polynomial time complexity, leveraging quantum parallelism to handle larger systems. However, VQE has limitations in the accuracy and expressibility of commonly used ansatzes.
